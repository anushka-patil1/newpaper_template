                    <p>The Mumbai Traffic Police has announced restrictions on several South Bombay routes in anticipation of the large inflow of people celebrating Gudi Padwa 2024. Gudi Padwa, marking the onset of spring and warmer days, also signifies the beginning of the Marathi New Year, celebrated with much pomp and show. As people prepare for rallies, here are the traffic restrictions to avoid congestion. It is advised to check traffic restrictions to avoid inconvenience.Marking the beginning of the traditional new year, Gudi Padwa is primarily celebrated by the people in Maharashtra and Goa. The auspicious festival derives its name from two words -- 'gudi' which is the flag of Lord Brahma and 'padwa', which signifies the first day of the phase of the moon. The occasion signals the onset of warmer days and the spring season. The festival is observed with colourful floor decorations, a special Gudhi flag garlanded with flowers, mango and neem leaves, and topped with upturned silver or copper vessels, street processions, dancing, and festive foods like shrikhand puri. Gudi Padwa coincides with the first day of the Chaitra Navratri and festivals like Sajibu Cheiraoba, Navreh, Cheti Chand and Ugadi that are celebrated in different parts of the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Governor of Maharashtra Ramesh Bais have extended their greetings to the nation on the occasion of Gudi Padwa 2024.

                        In a message, Governor Bais said, "I extend my heartiest greetings to all on the occasion of Gudi Padwa and the commencement of the New Year."

Despite her impoverished background and the pressure from her parents, who had already married off her three sisters, Nirmala refused to give up on her education. When her parents sought to end her schooling due to financial constraints and the lack of a nearby junior college, Nirmala sought help from local legislator Y Saiprasad Reddy during his outreach programme.</p>
